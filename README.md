# Point&Plan

Our website, point&plan, welcomes the user on the landing page and allows them to select whether they're a student, a professor or an administrator (the principle, for example). From there, the user is redirected to the appropriate login space wherein they input their username as follows: first name, last name. They will be asked to input their ID as the password.
After correctly inputting the data, the user is redirected to the appropriate page; Students can see their full schedule, Professors have access to both student IDs and their schedule and finally, Admin has access to the list of student IDs, the full schedule comprised of every class and has the ability to export the table to JSON.
